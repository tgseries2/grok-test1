# MEV Sandwich Bot Implementation
## Code Structure

> main.py: Entry point, orchestrates the bot's components. \
> sandwich.py: Handles sandwich attack logic. \
> arbitrage.py: Manages flash loan arbitrage. \
> utils.py: Utility functions for reserves, profit calculations, etc. \
> config.py: Configuration settings.

## Required Libraries üìö

To run the MEV Sandwich Bot on Ubuntu, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- **web3.py**: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **flashbots**: For MEV protection and private transaction submission via Flashbots.
- **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

# MEV Sandwich Bot in Python

## Setup and Deployment Instructions

### Deploy `FlashLoanArbitrage.sol`
- Compile and deploy the contract on Ethereum Mainnet (or a testnet) using Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
- Update `FLASH_LOAN_CONTRACT` in `config.py` with the deployed address.

### Configure `.env`
- Ensure your `.env` file has `RPC_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, and `ACCOUNT` set up correctly, as described earlier.

### Install Dependencies
- Run `pip install web3.py flashbots python-dotenv` in your project directory to install the required Python libraries.

### Test the Bot
- Run `main.py` to start the bot, ensuring it connects to Ethereum, loads ABIs, and executes trades without errors.

# Key Features üöÄ

- ‚úÖ **Flash Loan Arbitrage**: Borrows capital from dYdX with zero upfront capital, executes arbitrage trades across multiple DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap), repays the loan within the same transaction, and only executes when profitable.
- ‚úÖ **Sandwich Attacks (MEV Exploits)**: Detects pending transactions in the mempool, front-runs a victim‚Äôs trade with a buy order, uses the victim‚Äôs order to increase the token price, and immediately sells after for profit, protected against failed or unprofitable trades.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Gas Optimization & MEV Protection**: Prioritizes low-gas cost execution, uses gas-efficient smart contract calls, avoids front-running by other bots with Flashbots or private mempools.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Profitability Checks & Error Handling**: Ensures only profitable trades are executed, double-checks prices and slippage, skips unprofitable or failed transactions, and logs errors to prevent execution failures.
- üì° **On-Chain & Off-Chain Components**: Uses Web3.py to interact with Ethereum-based DEXs, loads contract ABIs dynamically, and monitors the Ethereum mempool in real-time for opportunities.
- ‚ö° **Atomic Execution**: Ensures all transactions (borrowing, swapping, repaying) happen in one atomic transaction; if any step fails, the entire transaction reverts, preventing losses.
- üåê **Compatibility & Scalability**: Works with Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, BSC, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible chains, integrates with private RPCs or Flashbots for stealth execution, and runs 24/7 without manual intervention.
