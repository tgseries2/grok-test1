# MEV Sandwich Bot in Python

## Setup and Deployment Instructions

### Deploy `FlashLoanArbitrage.sol`
- Compile and deploy the contract on Ethereum Mainnet (or a testnet) using Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
- Update `FLASH_LOAN_CONTRACT` in `config.py` with the deployed address.

### Configure `.env`
- Ensure your `.env` file has `RPC_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, and `ACCOUNT` set up correctly, as described earlier.

### Install Dependencies
- Run `pip install web3.py flashbots python-dotenv` in your project directory to install the required Python libraries.

### Test the Bot
- Run `main.py` to start the bot, ensuring it connects to Ethereum, loads ABIs, and executes trades without errors.
